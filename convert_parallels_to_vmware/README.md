# Migrating Parallels Virtual Machines to VMware Fusion: A Step-by-Step Guide

## Overview

This guide provides a comprehensive process for migrating virtual machines from Parallels to VMware Fusion. It includes instructions for installing necessary tools, locating the required files, performing conversions, and importing the converted virtual machines into VMware Fusion.

## Prerequisites

Before beginning the migration process, ensure you have the following:

- **`qemu-img`**: A command-line tool for converting virtual disk formats. Install it from the [QEMU website](https://www.qemu.org/download/) or use a package manager:
  - **macOS**: `brew install qemu`
  - **Linux**: `sudo apt-get install qemu-utils`
  
  Using the latest version of `qemu-img` ensures better compatibility and performance.

## Migration Steps

### 1. Install `qemu-img`

Ensure `qemu-img` is installed on your system. Refer to the [QEMU installation guide](https://wiki.qemu.org/Download) or use the appropriate package manager for your operating system.

### 2. Locate the Parallels Hard Drive (.hds) File

Find your Parallels virtual machine’s hard drive file:

- **macOS**: Navigate to `~/Parallels`
- **Windows**: Access the directory where Parallels virtual machines are stored

To locate the `.hds` file:
1. Right-click the `.pvm` file.
2. Select "Show Package Contents."
3. Locate the `.hds` file within the package.

### 3. Convert the Parallels Hard Drive to VMware Fusion Format

**Important:** Back up the original `.hds` file before conversion. Use the following command to convert the `.hds` file to a VMware Fusion-compatible format (`.vmdk`):

```sh
qemu-img convert -O vmdk /path/to/parallels.hds /path/to/vmware_fusion.vmdk
```

Replace `/path/to/parallels.hds` with the path to your `.hds` file and `/path/to/vmware_fusion.vmdk` with your desired output file location and name.

### 4. Import the Converted Hard Drive into VMware Fusion

1. Open VMware Fusion.
2. Click on "New" to create a new virtual machine.
3. When prompted for installation media, select "Use another disk or image."
4. Browse to and select the `.vmdk` file you created.

### 5. Configure the VMware Fusion Virtual Machine

Follow the on-screen instructions to set up your virtual machine:

- Adjust memory allocation
- Configure network settings
- Set up the operating system

Ensure that you select appropriate settings based on your needs.

### 6. Start the Virtual Machine

After completing the setup, start your virtual machine in VMware Fusion. Your Parallels virtual machine should now be fully functional within VMware Fusion.

## Compatibility

This guide is compatible with the following software versions:

- **Parallels Desktop**: Version 10 and above. Earlier versions may work, but using a recent version is recommended for optimal results.
- **VMware Fusion**: Version 8 and above. For the best experience, use a recent version of VMware Fusion.

Ensure both Parallels and VMware Fusion are updated to avoid compatibility issues.
